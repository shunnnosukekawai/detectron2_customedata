Explanation for using custom datasets for detectron2
====

I used the two datasets [FUNSD](https://guillaumejaume.github.io/FUNSD/) and [RVL-CDIP Dataset](https://zenodo.org/record/3257319#.XtzbH577TjB) .
FUNSD is well-organized data while RVL-CDIP is a data that needs to be pre-processed.
I have two explanations for them, that you can check from bellow.

* [RVL-CDIP Dataset](RVL-CDIP.md)
